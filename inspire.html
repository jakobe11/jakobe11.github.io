        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone that you look up to for not just their personality or talent, but for their morals and values as well. A hero is someone who always does whats best not just for themselves but the people around them too. </p>
        <p>My personal hero is Muhammad Ali just for those reasons. Muhammad Ali morals and values were one of a kind. Ali stood up for what he loved and didn't care what people thought about it. He is considered the best boxer of all time and during his peak ages he stepped away from the ring to protest against the Vietnam war. This shows true charachter and no matter how much money you make or how good you are at something standing up for what you beleive is right and making a change for good is above nobody, and Muhammad Ali embodies this perfectly.</p>
